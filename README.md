CS540 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) Projects

## Have the choice of using any languages to write the code but I used Java for P1 and Python for the rest

- Project 1 (P1) consists of building a logistic regression model and a neural network to classify hand-written digits. The models should take pixel    intensities of images as inputs and output which digits the images display. 

- Project 2 (P2) consists of building a decision stumps and a decision tree to diagnose whether a patient has some disease based on their symptoms and medical test results. Unfortunately, we do not have a nice dataset on COVID-19, so we will use the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The models will read in integer-valued patient data and output a diagnosis of whether the patient has breast cancer. 

- Project 3 (P3) consists of building and simulating a simple Markov chain model based on a movie script. You will use it to generate new sentences that hopefully contain sensible words maybe even phrases. In addition, you will build a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish sentences from the script and sentences from another fake script. Due to the English vocabulary size, we will use characters as features instead of words. In practice, we could replace the 26 letters by (more than 170,000) English words when training these models. 

- Project 4 (P4) consists of clustering US states into groups with the COVID-19 dataset. We will estimate parametric models of virus spread and cluster the states using these parameters as features. 

- Project 5 (P5) consists of creating a random maze and compare multiple uninformed and informed search algorithms.
